It provides all the simulation code and scripts required to reproduce the figures from the papers.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install the [Julia runtime](http://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Start the Julia [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) and clone the package by calling `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/rasmusbrandt/DistributedBaseStationClustering.jl")`.
3. From the terminal, run the corresponding batch scripts in the `batch` subdirectory.
4. When the run has finished, the plots in the paper can be generated by calling the appropriate plot scripts.

The scripts in the root directory can be used for exploratory simulations.

## Journal paper results
The results in the journal paper are available in the `batch/tsp` subdirectory on the `master` branch. The code in this branch is compatible with both Julia 0.3 and 0.4.

## Asilomar paper results
The results in the Asilomar conference paper are available in the `batch/asilomar` subdirectory on the `asilomar2015` branch. Since this branch is older, its code is only compatible with Julia 0.3.

### Software Dependencies
[CoordinatedPrecoding.jl][CoordinatedPrecodingJL] is used as a supporting framework for the simulations.

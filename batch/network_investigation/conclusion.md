# Conclusion from network_investigation
I need a general enough network that I can study different network regimes. For
example, I might want to study different number of BSs, MSs, distances, etc.
This does not really hold for IndoorsNetwork and TriangularHetNetNetwork.
Further, these networks generally seem to have the grand coalition as optimal
for the studied scenarios, which is boring for us.

## IndoorsNetwork
- Too boring with a linear network.
- Grand coalition is optimal, e.g. not interesting for us.

## RandomLargeScaleNetwork
- This is the one to use.
- Should I use fixed or random user positions?

## TriangularHetNetNetwork
- Not interference-limited enough.
- Grand coalition is optimal for the networks that I studied,
  e.g. not interesting for us.

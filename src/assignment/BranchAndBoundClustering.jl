# Optimal base station clustering based on branch and bound.
#
# A branch and bound tree is developed which describes all possible
# restricted growth strings that describe all possible base station
# clusters. The utilities are taken from utilities.jl. The bounds are
# very simple: The pre-log factors are bounded by the current pre-log
# factor for already clustered BSs, and bounded by 1 for non-clustered BSs.
# The spectral efficiency bounds are assuming that non-clustered BSs do
# not contribute interference to already clustered BSs, and non-clustered
# BSs have their utopian (interference-free) spectral efficiencies as bounds.
